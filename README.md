## The Story behind the Project

The Story behind the Project is relatively simple. I was Scrolling through Pinterest and looking at some DIY Smartwatches.
Pinterest then suggested to me a Hackaday article about Retro LED Segment-displays/Matrix-displays, in which i immeadetly found interest.
One of the listed Displays did catch my Eye, the HDSP-2000 Series Alphanumeric Matrix Display in DIP-Package format made by HP.
In that moment i knew i needed one of these Chips just to play around, perhaps even use in an actual Project; This is that Project.
So i Started to Design my ESP32s3 based smartwatch which would use the HDSP-2000 as the Display.

## Goals for this Project:

- [x]  Design a RTC/c Circuit
- [x]  Design the HDSP-2000 Driver Circuit
- [x]  Add a Buzzer
- [x]  Add an IO expander
- [x]  Add Testpads
- [ ]  SMD Solder the PCB
- [ ]  Test the PCB ==without== the Displays to verify the Driver Circuit
- [ ]  Test the PCB ==with== the Displays
- [ ]  SUCCESS! ðŸŽ‰

## Quick start guide

1. Order the PCB from JLCPCB or PCBWAY (not sponsored)
2. Solder the componenets onto the board (i recommend the [SAND TECHNIQUE](https://youtu.be/DYrucIWig24?si=pEKrY5gaIevp7irn&t=319))
3. Test the PCB for connection errors or Shorts
4. insert your favorite colored HDSP-2000 series display (or other [Compatible models]())
5. Flash the Firmware [download here]().
6. Download the App [from here]().
7. SUCCESS! ðŸŽ‰
